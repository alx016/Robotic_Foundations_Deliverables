# DESCRIPTION

The signalGenerator creates a sinusoidal signal, and uses an external file (signal_msg) to publish the signal and the 
time. Then the signalProcessor subscribes to both, the signal and the time, and modifies the signal to create a new 
signal that is later plot.

signal_result.launch - helps you launch the files without the need to open several terminals and run ruscore in one 
of them.
